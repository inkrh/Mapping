"Tijera and Mazunte, Oaxaca 2664","Bleaching : In spring and summer 1998, when the anti-El Nino event was present in the eastern Pacific, corals remained in good condition in Oaxaca, although surface temperature was noticeably lower than normal, especially in May. However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of Mexico and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.

The milleporan, M. alcicornis, is primarily an encrusting coral. Several of the rapidly growing, branching taxa (Acropora cervicornis, A . palmata,Porites porites, ""finger Porites""), which are known to have been affected by the mass bleaching event at these sites are presumed to have mostly recovered before the point-count surveys began. Diploria labyrinthiformis was considered a good indicator of prolonged bleaching at 8-10 m at this site

"Kijembe Reef, Mombasa 4036","Bleaching : There is currently a mild coral bleaching event occurring on reefs adjacent to Mombasa, Kenya. My observations come from Kijembe Reef (a lagoonal patch reef), just north of the coastal town of Mombasa. NOAA satellite monitoring currently shows the accumulated thermal stress in thewaters around Kenya and Tanzania to be 3 DHW.<br>Pocillopora is the main group to be affected (P. eydouxi, P. verrucosa andP. damicornis) with normal, pale and fully bleached colonies observed. Othergenera showing pale tissue include Porites, Platygyra, Echinopora, Galaxea,Goniopora, Astreopora, Montipora and Hydnophora (one individual only).Acropora species at the site are all normal, and have only been affected bycrown-of-thorns starfish which are present in elevated numbers at the site.<br>No colonies appeared to have died from bleaching to date.The SE monsoon winds, high cloud cover and rains we have been experiencing should help to reduce bleaching stress.

Kiunga 3918,"Bleaching : Paling of coral colonies was first observed in Kiunga during monitoring prior to March 24, however it was so mild that it was not specially noted.  From April 4 in Kiunga, bleaching was first observed and reported widely.  Following that, pale, partially bleached and some fully bleached corals were reported widely throughout Kenya. Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are paling, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected. After Pocillopora, the most strongly affected genera include Porites, Echinopora, Galaxea and partially affected genera include Platygyra, Acropora, Montipora, various faviids and fungiids, Pavona.

In that period the reefs of Mkwaja and Kipumbwi Villages were assessed. Several species of fungid corals are either fully bleached or dead. In addition, Porites spp. and Acropora spp are paling or are completely bleached. Fully bleached colonies were mainly observed in shallow water, similar as reported by David Obura for Kenya. At the moment the surface water temperature of Tanga area is 28.6 Celcius.

Tampolo Marine Reserve in Antongil Bay 4034,"Bleaching : We would like to report a bleaching event in north-east Madagascar. On a field trip to Tampolo Marine Reserve in Antongil Bay last week (15 - 18 March) we observed significant bleaching in shallow waters between 2 and 4 m depth. Initial estimates indicate that around 80% of massive corals and 50% of encrusting corals were bleached, either completely or partially. Between 4 and 7 metres bleaching was also seen, but to a lesser extent. <br>Soft corals, anemones and giant clams were also affected in shallow waters. Bleaching was observed at other locations in Antongil Bay, at Nosy Mangabe and at the northern mouth of the bay at Cap Masoala. Anecdotal reports indicate an unusually calm and rain-free period with clear skies for the first half of March.

Seawater temperatures have been measured as being up to 32oC and as in Madagascar, the area has been subjected to a period of unusually hot and calm weather.

Likewise, reports have been made that the white sea egg (Tripneustes ventricosus) has been going through a mortality event of their own.

The reefs at Speyside and on the Atlantic side do not seem so badly affected from reports from dive operators.

Tobago reef 6877,"Bleaching : As a follow up to my pervious post on ""Coral bleaching and an unknown sponge disease in Tobago"", I returned to a monitoring site, surveyed only 10 dys earlier, and I to my dismay, within the 20-40ft depth area there is mass mortality of the Giant Barrel Sponges (Xestospongia muta).  Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speysides reefs are generally spongedominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastreafaveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  Atdeeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only ofparticular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  Thewater temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggersrecording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C. Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer livedand slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas andSiderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities andMadracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed. M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location Ive beenable to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleachingalong the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.Jahson Alemu ICoral Reef Ecologist

Atolls lagoon 4028,"Bleaching : In August, I noted recent bleaching of corals of the genus Acropora.  Both A. palmata and A. cervicornis showed signs of the bleaching, but no other species seemed to be affected.  The observations were taken in three different locations within the atolls lagoon (no observations taken on the fore reef) during repeated benthic transects.  That genus is already found in low numbers within Glovers due to its slow recovery after Hurricane Mitch in 98 and various other bleaching events.  In an odd twist, I did some work at the Brooklyn Aquarium (WCS) in the coral culture lab in May and noted bleachingamong our Acropora samples just before I left.  Even samples in SEPARATE tanks were showing the same bleaching trends.  Not sure if there is a correlation, but an interesting observation none the less.

Glovers Reef Atoll 4081,"Bleaching : Some degree of Bleaching is occurring here at Glovers Reef Atoll, Belize.Millepora & Porites porites upper surface bleaching has been ongoing for about two months.  Around the end of August to start of September deep water plating Agaricia species bleached bright white along the east wall of the atoll, although shaded colonies under overhangs, etc remain brown & not visibly affected.  At the same time occasional bleached plating Agaricia colonies were also visible on the fore-reef.  Also at the beginning of September, a few Montastraea annularis colonies showed signs of paling - this situation has worsened, and now more M. annularis colonies are showing signs of paling, at least at two locations on the Eastern side of the Atoll (Middle Caye and Long Caye). However, of these two areas Middle Caye is much more affected, with maybe as much as 80% (V. approximate guesstimate) of colonies showing visible paling, whereas at Long Caye this figure might be around 20%.  However, at both sites no bright white M. annularis colonies have been seen.Apart from the Agaricia, where a zone of bleached coral can be seen between 20 - 40m depth, the rest of these observations are from the fore-reef, in depths of around 8 - 15 m, i.e. to the edge of the drop-off.

Arrecife La Boquita 7205,"Bleaching : Reef in the Bay of Santiago  in Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. Coral patches cover an area of 3876.2 m2. In 2003 a small jetty was constructed between the sea and the Juluapan lagoon adjacent to the north-west margin of the reef.This zone is constantly exposed to increases of temperature influenced by the diurnal contributions from the Juluapan Lagoon, from which influxes of water at 27.5 and 32.0C in winter and summer, respectively.During the summer of 2004 (April - June) diving campaigns were undertaken to study the bleaching phenomenon in this zone.  Bleaching evaluations of Pocillopora capitata were conducted by assessing  the concentrations of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids from samples along submarine transect lines.The coralline population at La Boquita is under a state of local thermal stress, which is a direct consequence of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon, which could cause irreversible damage to the reefs productivity, adaptability and regeneration capacity.

Akumal reef 6766,"Bleaching : An intense bleaching event is also occurring along the Mexican Caribbean Coast. Our first observations of pale corals was done in May in Akumal reef, with 7% of the colonies showing pale coloration at a depth of 10-15m. By June, 9% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Mahahual Reef at the same depth. By July, 32% of the colonies were bleached-pale in Punta Allen reef.At present, (August-September) surveys at Puerto Morelos reef show that 41% of the colonies were bleached and 31% of them were completely white.Surveys were done at a depth of 4-8m.The number of colonies sampled at each site was over 2000. Almost all scleractinian species showed bleaching signs, as well as some gorgonians, Milleporas and zoanthids.

Lee Stocking Island 3974,"Bleaching : Bleaching, which was first noted at the end of September , extends to depths of at least 55 meters . By early October, about 18 species of scleractinians, Millepora, many gorgonians , several other groups of soft-bodied cnidarians, and possibly som e sponges had been affected to some degree . In several species, up to 96-98% of the specimens examined were either pale (i .e . , containing few zooxanthellae or reduced amounts of accessory photosynthetic pigments), partly bleached (some soft tissues are white) or completely bleached . Patterns and extent of bleaching varied with species and habitat and, in some groups, (e .g. Millepora, gorgonians) increased with depth.

"Rainbow Garden (on the bank), Perry Reef (shallow fringing reef, 20 m), and Adderley Dropoff (shelf-edge reef, 33 m), Lee Stocking Island 3984","Bleaching : Widespread bleaching observed in mid-August 1990 at 20-25 m on the shelf-edge fringing reef and involved 1-2% of the reef . By mid-September bleaching was observed in a depth range of 2-46 m . Bleaching at 20 m consisted of about 25% of the reef. Bleached organisms included stony coral, gorgonians, and sponges. Bleaching continued to increase in number of colonies affected through the first week of October.  One loggerhead sponge (Spheciospongia vesparia) at 35 m, reduced in size through tissue loss in 1987, bleached again in 1990 . No further bleaching was observed in 1991 or 1992.Type of organism affected:Porifera (sponge) Aplysina spp . Spheciospongia vesparia Xestospongia muta;: Hydrozoa (fire coral) Millepora alcicornis; Scleractinia (hard coral) Acropora cervicornis Agaricia agaricites Diploria strigosa Montastrea annularis Montastrea cavernosa Porites porites; Gorgonacea (soft coral) several unidentified species.Coral bleaching occurred at Lee Stocking Island following a short period (18 days) of daily average water temperatures above 30 .5`C on the bank in July-August 1990 followed by another temperature peak in mid-September. A maximum temperature of 32.5C was reached on 23 September 1990 . The July monthly average for 1990 did not differ from surrounding years, but August and September were significantly wanner in 1990. The 5-yr record at the LSI dock distinctly shows a longer-term maxima in 1990.

San Salvador 4324,"Bleaching : During the week of November 20th, 2005, an Earthwatch Institute Research Team ""The Bahamian Reef Survey"" discovered a bleaching event in progress on patch reefs around San Salvador, Bahamas. The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.

San Salvador 7288,"Bleaching : Earthwatch Institute research-team conducted seasonal monitoring on shallow-water patch reefs on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent. Also, as part of a reef restoration experiment, many Acropora palmata transplants suffered mortality since the projects last monitoring effort in July.  Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.Also, for the last two months there have been excessive winds with the elevations of both high and low tides being far greater (and sustained) than anyone could ever remember

Grand Cayman 6768,"Bleaching : I have just been informed by Croy McCoy that they are having an intense and widespread bleaching event in Grand Cayman. He went diving yesterday and found totally bleached corals down to 30 m, observations indicate that close to 100% of scleractinians showed bleaching signs in deeper environments, and around 80% in shallower habitats. Water temps. Have been above 29 Celcius since June (Hobo data). I will be conducting disease surveys in mid-November, so if anything like what we saw in 2005 with WPD and YBD outbreaks during and after the massive bleaching occurs here, we will probably have a chance to document this in our permanent survey transects around the island. Croy will be conducting quantitative surveys and tagging colonies in the next days. On the other hand, here in Puerto Rico, there are no signs of a bleaching event. Just the usual, a few pale colonies here and there. Same situation observed during our disease surveys last week in Grenada.

Not sure if this means that the coral is being killed or if it is rebounding and growing over previously dead coral.In the area, lobster fishing with compressors is supposedly illegal but this is not enforced. Most of the fishermen use air compressors to dive on the reefs. This is a popular site for lobster fishing and spear gun fishing on the reefs. Fishermen drop anchors on reef - could benefit from buoys.

"Kingston, Lime Cay (The South Coast) 4094","Bleaching : The current bleaching trend noted on Caribbean reefs, was also observed in Jamaica. Sampled by scuba diving; bleaching, ranging from partial to full and patchy to total, was observed between 10 - 30 ft depth, along the fore reef of Lime Cay, in the following species:             Acropora cervicornis (~40% patchy)Colpophyllia natans Diplora labrynthiformisDiplora strigosaMeandrina meandricitesMillepora alcicornis and M. complanata (~80% bleached, >20% full) Montastrea annularis( ~20% mainly partial) Porites astreoides Siderastrea radians                        Siderastrea siderea (~30% greatest diversity of intensity)Agaricia agaricitesIn addition to this, diseases also appeared to be more popular. Interesting to note, spawning of M. annularis, including bleached colonies, was observed on Saturday the 24 at about 9:50pm; however, no A. cervicornis spawning was observed at the sites sampled neither on Friday nor Saturday.

"Montego Bay, Doctors Cave beach and westward. (north coast) 4093","Bleaching : Sampled by snorkeling observation was the area of Drs Cave Beach westward to the spur and groove formations and drop to 10M depth, an area of approximately 200m (west) x50m (north) including shallow lagoon/patch reef, reef crest and spur and groove reef. The area has been sampled using REEFCHECK to contain between 16% and 21% live coral. Bleaching observed within shallow lagoon areas (<3M depth) behind reef and areas likely influenced by warm lagoon waters.This bleaching event is not as yet particularly intensive. It will be observed for change in the coming weeks.Water temperature was measured by Citizen wrist-mounted digital thermometer to be 31 degrees Celsius.Level and prominence of bleaching observed as follows:Millepora spp. (mainly complanata): Bleaching occurring in less then 50% of colonies. Bleaching intensity strong in less then 25% of cases.Montastrea annularis: Bleaching occurring in less then 20% of colonies. No colonies larger then 30cm diameter affected. Bleaching rarely (<10 of cases) more intense then simple fading of colour from uppermost area.Acropora cervicornis: Bleaching occurring on 70% of colonies observed; patchy, and mainly on upper surfaces of branch. Larger colonies (30CM diameter) more likely to be affected then small colonies and single branches. Bleaching accompanied by white band disease in four colonies. (A. cervicornis is relatively rare. <20 colonies observed total). Agaricia agaricites: Bleaching observed on colony ridges, patchy. Less then 20 individuals observed displaying notable bleaching in this locally common species.  Porites porites: Bleaching observed as fading of colour on upper faces of branches and growth tips in four colonies, all of the brown morph. This species and morph is common.Palythoa caribaeorum: one colony observed to be partially bleached, colours faded on its upper surface. This species is uncommon in this area. (< 10 colonies observed)Report by Andrew Ross, UWI MPhil candidate.

Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park) 4059,"Bleaching : A massive bleaching of corals is taking place since aprox 10-15 days (since late June) at Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park) near the city of Cartagena, Colombia. I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Martin de Pajarales Island. Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report.  No sponges had bleached. Even brown encrusting Cliona, which harbor zooxanthellae, were fine. Photos can be seen at http://www.invemar.org.co/redcostera1/invemar/coral-bleaching-photos-by-sven-zea/

His observation was that thermal stress was having an impact on  the marine environment. <br>Diadema population appeared to be rather abundant and healthy.

At this time, water temperatures were about 30 C at 0-3 meters depth.  By mid-August, loss of zooxanthellae was noted in 14 species of scleractinian reef, Millepora and in several species of soft-bodied cnidarians . Zoexanthellate sponges were not affected . Overall, the patterns and extent of bleaching were highly variable, both among species and among locations but were confined to shallow 6 meters) habitats, At that time the event was judged to be lesssevere than the bleaching episode of 1983.Species affected Scleractinians : Acropora palmata, A . cervicornis, Agaricia agaricites, A tenuifolia, porites astreoides, P . porites, Favia fragum, Diploria clivosa, D. labyrinthiformis, D. strigosa, Colpophyilia natans, Montastraea annularis Other Cnidarians : Millepora, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Palythoa A tenuifolia and Erythropodium caribaeorum were all bleached, others are partially bleached, except for A. cervicornis which was fine.

"Tayrona Natural National Park,  off the city of Santa Marta 4321","Bleaching : Pale colonies of Montastraea annularis were first observed inshallow waters (<10m) at Bahia de Nenguange on the 21st of October. A week later, most M. annularis colonies were bleached, showing the classicbleaching pattern being more intense on top than on the sides, whileColpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November thebleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularisand Porites porites were severely bleached, while most M. faveolata,Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides,Siderastrea siderea, Millepora spp., and the zoanthid Palythoacaribbaeorum were partially bleached. Similar observations were made incoral reefs of Bahia de Taganga, adjacent to the TNNP, however, most P.astreoides colonies were severely bleached in Taganga, in contrast toBahia de Neguange. It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite latecompared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs atIslas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 monthsearlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. Thismight have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs inthe area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and byJuly-August. Surface water temperature measurements taken in November 11 at noon: 29C.

"Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela) 4323","Bleaching : In Cayo Sombrero (Morrocoy National Park, MNP Venezuela) we observed that bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST of July-September, but a month later, similarly to the report made to the coral list by G. Diaz et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was30C. By the end of October, SST was also 30C but we found that 21 - 40% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: M. franksi (50%)M. faveolata (31%)C. natans (15%)M. meandrites (100%)A. agaricites (67%) hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. We will keep monitoring this event and hope to report the recovery of the colonies in the next weeks.

Boynton Beach 4083,"Bleaching : Dives conducted on Oct. 1, 2005, in Boynton Beach, FL confirm the presence of bleaching Meandrina meandrites colonies. This is the sixth year in a row bleaching of this species has been documented to begin within days following the Autumnal Equinox. On Oct. 1, 2005 approximately 3% of the M. meandrites colonies were observed to be completely bleached. This observation is consistent with prior years (2000 through 2004). If this episode follows the earlier pattern the peak of bleaching will occur the last week of October with all colonies repigmented by the end of November.

Cheeca Rocks (Middle Keys Patch Reefs) 4069,"Bleaching : At Florida Keys inshore patch reef sites, Cheeca Rocks, extensive coral bleaching has been observed affecting up to 80% of scleractinian corals.  Cheeca Rocks is located offshore of the middle Florida Keys and this sites are currently being monitored as part of a dissertation study on coral disease. <br>Five 16m2 permanent plots were established at each of these sites in August of 2004 and a total of 266 corals at Cheeca Rocks have been monitored for the incidence of bleaching and disease since that time.<br>On August 11th, 2005, I observed some partial bleaching affecting only a few of the monitored colonies. When I returned on August 16th, paling and partial bleaching was occurring on 19% of the monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks.  This bleaching was mainly affecting species of Colpophyllia natans and Montastrea faveolata. However, at this point all of the monitored colonies of Agaricia agaricites within the quadrats were completely bleached. <br>On September 1st, I revisited the sites to find that 74% of monitored corals at Cheeca Rocks were experiencing some extent of bleaching (paling, partial bleaching, or total colony bleaching).  The proportions of all colonies experiencing total bleaching (i.e. no observable color from zooxanthellae) were 11% at Cheeca Rocks.  <br>Species most affected by the bleaching were C. natans, M. faveolata, and A. agaricites.  Other species found bleaching included M. annularis, M. cavernosa, Dichocoenia stokesii, Diploria clivosa, D. strigosa, D. labrynthiformis, Favia fragum, Meandrina meandrites, Mussa angulosa, Porites astreoides, P. porites, Siderastrea radians, S. siderea, and Stephanocoenia intersepta.  Species other than scleractinian corals observed to be bleaching included Millepora alcicornis, M. complanata, Palythoa caribaeorum, Erythropodium caribaeorum, Briareum asbestinum, and some other gorgonians. The only notable exception was individuals of Mycetophyllia spp. which appeared healthy and experienced no noticeable bleaching.<br>Water temperature was recorded during each site visit with a YSI-30 atdepths of 1 meter and 5 meters from the surface.

This species bleaches almost every year. Few colonies of the crutose octocoral (Erythropodium caribaeorum and Briaeorun asbestinum also showed bleaching signs. Within the corals, the  Agaricia agaricites species complex (A. agaricites, A. humilis, A. danae, A. purpurea) was the most affected with most colonies highly bleached in shallow habitats and few bleached and pale colonies in deeper (15-20m) habitats. Several large colonies of Colpophyllia natans and Siderastrea siderea between 6 an 12 m  were fully bleached (White and blue respectively)   and several more were pale and/or showing patchy white areas. Small colonies of  Porites porites  and P. divaricata, and a large number of colonies of  P astreoides were totally white. Few colonies of Stephanocoenia intersepta in deeper habitats showed paling and bleached patches. Only broken fragments of  Millepora lying flat on the bottom were bleached.

A number of belt transects were conducted (same locations as January 2006 surveys), 15 meters long by 1 meter wide, in which every coral colony was counted and scored as to its bleaching condition (totally bleached, partially bleached or unbleached). Transects were established from known reference points (mooring buoy anchor pins). <br>The average number of coral colonies affected by bleaching ranged from 5.7% (East FGB). As a reminder, this is compared to an average of 42% in October, and 46% in November and continued recovery was documented at the East FGB; January (10.3%) and March (4.0%). <br>Of the species affected, Millepora alcicornis, Stephanocoenia intersepta and Montastraea cavernosa had colonies that were considered still ""totally bleached"" (0.5%), with most species scored as ""partially bleached"".

Temp : 73 degrees F (22.8 degrees C).
Other : Coral disease surveys were conducted along transects varying from 15m x 1m wide to 50m x 1m at both the East and West Flower Garden Banks. Coral colonies exhibited white plague like symptoms on 8.34% at the East FGB. In localized areas at the East FGB, up to 20% of the colonies were affected. In the previous bleaching surveys (October and November) no disease was noted on the transects. White plague symptoms were noted on Colpophyllia natans, Diploria strigosa, Porites astreoides, Montastrea annularis, M. faveolata, and M. franksi. 
Disease was also affecting the single known colony of Acropora palmata on the East FGB. Last year, 2005, was the first year a widespread coral disease event was documented at the Flower Garden Banks NMS, affecting seven species. This also was a winter event.

Limited surveys revealed significant mechanical impacts at all three sites within the Sanctuary, including large boulders of reef rock and coral (up to 4m x2m in size) removed and tossed around the reef and into the sand flats, and at up to 1m of sand removed from the sand flats.  Large barrel sponges (Xestospongia muta) have suffered considerable damage, including partial and full removal, or filling up with sand. Coral tissue, sediment, and water samples were collected for contaminant analysis through a collaboration between the FGBNMS, NCCOS, and the University of Hawaii.  These collections were made in response to a large body of polluted water that made its way out from the TX/LA coast to the FGBNMS after Hurricane Rita (see http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/tsm/search.html).","Family :

"Buck Island, St. Croix 4113","Bleaching : The reefs surrounding Buck Island were experiencing a dramatic bleaching event.   I would estimate that 70% of the hard corals were either partially or fully bleached. Almost all of the Montastraea colonies were completely bleached except for M. cavernosa, in which we only noticed some partial bleaching. A majority of the Acropora palmata colonies were either bleached or partially bleached.  Species from the genera Diploria, Porites, Siderastrea, and Millepora were also affected. We also noticed several bleached mats of Palythoa spp.. Most of the corals still appeared to be alive but there were a couple with signs of new algae growth.

"Buck Island, St. Croix 4326","Bleaching : During October 16-30, 2005, bleaching was observed in 53% of corals at 91 of 94 randomly selected sites raging in depth between 9 and 91 ft  (2.7 and 27.5 m). Twelve coral species had bleaching greater than 50%, with four species being more than 90% bleached (Diploria labrynthiformis, Agaricia spp., Mycetophyllia spp., and Montastraea annularis). Several abundant corals also were severely bleached; four corals (M. annularis, D. strigosa, Porites astreoides, and Agaracia spp.) had cover greater than 9,850 cm 2 and experienced bleaching from 40 - 95%. Fire corals (Millepora spp.) comprised 11,400 cm 2 of total cover and were bleached 60%. Acropora palmata covered 21,800 cm 2 of the sampled area but was less severely bleached (23%). Some corals had bleaching less than 20% (Stephanocoenia. interceptis, Madracis spp., Dichocoenia stokesii, Meandrina meandrites), and other corals had no bleaching (Acropora cervicornis; Diploria cylindricus, Eusmilia spp., and Scolymia spp., In general, the coral bleaching event was widespread and occurred all around Buck Island but with no obvious spatial patterns. Also, no spatial patterns were observed in the occurrence of bleaching for four abundant coral species. A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface. However, water temperature, measured with a dive computer (Oceanic ProPlus 2) was not significantly lower at deeper sites than at shallower sites (r 2 = 0.004, P = 0.633, F = 0.230, df = 60). Overall, the water temperature ranged from 82 to 95 oF with a mean = 88.9 - 0.19 oF (from 27.7 to 35 oC, mean = 31.6 - 0.1 oC).For more information, please refere to  http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/products/biogeography/coral_bleaching/welcome.html

Measured 90.2% bleached coral in September 2005. Report on 11/5/2005 During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US VirginIslands, weve noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend tonormal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This hashappened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least somelight color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale tofull normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color morerapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60ft (4.6-8.3 m).The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site atTektite Reef went from 30.4C (86.7F) in September to 29.6C (85.3F)in October.October was a very rainy and cloudy month.

"Minabe town, Wakayama Pref. 7036","Bleaching : ""Live hard coral percentage at -5m depth transect line was down to 40% in 2005 survey from 80% in 2004, because the low seawater temperature in 2004-2005 winter season killed many hard coral. But it recovered year by year, at this year, the live hard coral percentage come back to 70%. This recovery of hard coral percentage means hard coral in this area grow up well and the environment for hard coral keeps good. And other reason, main stream of the Kuroshio current, major warm current in western Pacific ocean, stays near shore of Kii peninsula in a last few years, so the seawater temperature in winter keeps not so cold. This 70% of live hard coral percentage is very good to compare to Okinawa area, the hard coral in Okinawa got major damage in a few years. We found many Drupella spp. in last survey, but this year, we cound not found them at the transect and near it, so we think an influence of these shell is not so high now. However, we have to note shell damage in the future. We found many tropical fishes like a kind of Pomacentridae species, they are not original indicator in RC but we choose some of them for additional indicator, we think one of the reason is the warm current stay near the shore. We found no major change in invertebrate survey.""We think the hard coral in this area will become good to 2004 level in next year if it will be not so cold, no typhoon and no eaten trace by shells or COTS, because the tabler type hard coral recover well. But we need to remember many coral died in 2004-2005 winter and it necessary for 4 years to recover it. This large tabler type hard coral colony is one of the most northern colony of the world (or Japan),  the periodic survey like RC in this area is very meaningful.

"Minabe town, Wakayama Pref. 7037","Bleaching : At the -10m, there are many massive and encrusting type colony, that is different from at the -5m depth transect, the dominant type of hard coral colony is tabler type. So we found only a little difference of live hard coral percentage at -10m transent. One of the reason is the environmental change in -10m is smaller than -5m.We think the hard coral in this area will become good to 2004 level in next year if it will be not so cold, no typhoon and no eaten trace by shells or COTS, because the tabler type hard coral recover well. But we need to remember many coral died in 2004-2005 winter and it necessary for 4 years to recover it. This large tabler type hard coral colony is one of the most northern colony of the world (or Japan),  the periodic survey like RC in this area is very meaningful.

(The transect in last survey in 2008 was placed on other reef - about 30m on shore from 2006 and 2009 survey reef.) The live hard coral percentage is 41.3%, it is getting good from 22.5% in 2006 survey. Here is no dominant coral but many kind of corals in this survey area. We found many silt at the 2008 survey, but we found no silt in small concave at the top of the reef. We think the condition for coral growing is good.

"Okinawa, Kohama Island 7102","Bleaching : Live hard coral percentage of 3m transect line is 61.3 %, but it was 15.6 % worse then last survey at Jun. 9, 2007. Almost of these decrease percentage were replaced by rock. We didnt find breaching coral on this survey, but we found some tabler type Acropora near the transect which contracted a disease, it maybe ""white syndrome."" On fish survey, we didnt find any major change of counts, but we found a Humphead Wrasse first time on ReefCheck at this point. On invertebrate survey, we didnt find any major change of counts, too, we found only two giant shells. We think the major reason of HC percentage decrease was the large scale bleaching in this area, Yaeyama Islands, in last (2007) summer, and the mortality of bleaching Acropora was high. But it past for almost one year, we could classify for RKC fewer then HC decrease points.

"Okinawa, Kohama Island 7103","Bleaching : The live hard coral percentage of 6m transect line is 57.5 %, it was 10.6 % worse then last survey at Jun. 9, 2007. And soft coral percentage of 6m transect line is 0.63 %, it was 5.62 % worse then last survey. These loss percentage of HC and SC was replaced for RC. We didnt find bleaching hard coral, but we found some disease tabler Acropora neaer the transect line, they maybe ""white syndrome."" We could not find any major change at fish and invertebrate survey. We think the major reason of HC and SC percentage decrease was the bleaching in last summer, like 3m transect, but the damage at 6m transect was less then 3m, because the depth protect from the stress by high water temperature and ultraviolet rays.In this Yaeyama area, coral reef got huge damage by bleaching, typhoon and crown of thorns, from summer of 2007 till winter. But this survey show the damage at northern reef of Yaeyama area was comparatively little. We need continuous survey at good condition area like here to protect Yaeyama area.

"Taketomi town, Okinawa 7033","Bleaching : The -3m transect line is placed at the upper area of reef slope, so there is a place where wave hit strong. The dominant corals are tabler type Acropora which size are 50 - 60 cm diameter, and there is high diversity, we found many kind of corals as arborescent type Acropora, Porites, Favia, Stylophora, Echinophyllia and soft corals. The live hard coral coverage by visual census is about 70 - 80 %, this is better than last survey. By the substrate survey, the percent of HC is changed from 61.3 % last year to 76.9 % this year. We found many young Acropora, which diameter is about 5 cm. We count only a few butterfly fish and parrot fish, and count only one giant shell, but it isnt big change from last survey. We found no COTS and no coral disease.The northern reef slope of Kohama island, where is this survey area, is one of the most healthy and beautiful sight place in Sekisei lagoon. There was no damage by typhoon, no bleaching in summer and no eaten by Crown of Thorns Starfish in a few years, so tabler type Acropora grow very well at the reef slope. For the last a few years, the live coral coverage in Sekisei lagoon became bad because there got many damage by COTS or other reason, so this area, where keeps good condition, is very important area for supply source of offspring. We want to set protected area in there because the COTS damage is expanding now, but it is hard to conservation in winter because it is bad condition in winter season by stron northern wind in this northern reef. So the long term and periodical survey by reef check is the one of the protective measures to take it soon.

Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary 4037,"Bleaching : Minor coral bleaching was observed on the 26th March 2005 among the reef crests of shallow coral banks of the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary. The depth varied between 1 and 2m. Below is a table of the species affected and the degree to which they were bleached. It was noted that all the colonies of affected species were not bleached. <br>Species affected and Level of bleaching<br>Leptoria phrygia - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>Favia pallida - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>Favia favus - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>Platygyra daedalea - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>Hydnophora microconos - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>Symphyllia radians - Partial bleaching<br> Pocillopora damicornis - Some branch tips only<br>Acropora muricata (formally A. formosa) - 2 small colonies totally bleached<br>Montipora foliosa - Edges of whorls bleached<br>In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.Minor coral bleaching was reported from SL last year too, from Trincomalee in the East coast and Rumassala reef in the south.

Bleaching in Trincomalee in Pigeon Island and Dutch bay was particularly serious. In May 2010 almost all corals in the shallows (up to about 3 m) at these two locations were bleached. So that is in excess of 90% bleaching. Only the shallows to a depth of about 6m was observed. Below 4 m there was partial bleaching. Montipora aequituberculata and some Pocillopora damicornis were not affected even though they in very shallow water of about 1m in depth.

Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem 6878,"Bleaching : Like  many  others diving in the Gulf of Thailand, we have been seeingsignificant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.  We will also be presenting our monitoring results at the 2^nd Asia-Pacific Coral Reef Symposium in Phuket later this month.

"Maumere Bay, Flores, Indonesia 6750","Bleaching : Percentage of live corals: 5-15 %Percentage of live corals that is bleached: 5-10%About 20-50% of Acropora colonies at 6 sites where bleached, many 100% bleached. Other taxa bleached include, Astreopora, Porites, various faviids, various softies beginning to pale and the odd anemone. No mortality was observed, and given it was mainly Acropora bleached and nothing bleaching mortality, my guess is this is early, say 2-4 weeks, into the event.Coral cover in Maumere Bay was consistently low. Mostly less than 10% on fringing reefs surrounding islands in the bay, and often approaching 0%. Some sites on mainland in reasonable condition (cover approx. 40 %).

Palu 7199,"Bleaching : 0% of recorded RKC due to bleaching, all due to COTs attack; Severe COTs attack - on previous monitoring COTs at shallower depth, now many at this depth. Many of the RKC and HC are mushroom corals, which seem to have increased in number at this depth compared to previous monitoring. The sand is mainly borderline sand/silt, but sand component larger, unlike the 3m where the silt component is dominant. Sponge includes many branching tubular sponges which have increased, as well as massive sponges. Soft coral has decreased. Most COTs off-transect/belt were near segments 3 and 4, seems that segments 1 and 2 have been pretty much totallt predated causing a shift in the COTs population to areas with remaining HC cover. Many COTs outside transect also, including a group of 15 individuals around 1 massive coral about 30cm diameter. COTs attack main cause of coral death and subsequent breaking to rubble. No trash unlike previous visit, maybe because seaweed farming has moved slightly and because fishing is now rare at this site, due to poor returns. No non-COTs bleaching and no disease visible.

Some recenly killed coral nearby seemingly due to poison fishing, several sea anemones also affected. Best coral in between the 3m and 10m (actually 7-8m)  transect, at around 4-5m and on the crest at below 2m depth. At these depths estimated HC cover around 40%. Estimate of original (pristine condition) HC cover around 60-75%, remainder sand and other biota (sponge, soft coral, tunicates etc). Little silt at this depth, maybe shifted by wave action, as heavy siltation on reef flat and below the shallow transect.Many crown of thornss at depths shallower than the transect. Some post-crown of thorns dead/broken coral covered in short algae, especially tabulate Acropora. No obvious bleaching but recenly killed coral seems due to crown of thornsS and poison fishing.

Pomolulu 7198,"Bleaching : 0% of recorded RKC is result of bleaching; Some RKC could be disease but cyanide use is prevalent and much dead coral was at the base of branching colonies where fish tend to take refuge, suspect some is cyanide damage. Some typical of COTs, although none seen on transect, many on nearby mainland reefs. Attractive seascape but very very few fish. Suspect much of the rubble is from the shallower depths where bomb damage is severe, mostly fragments of branching corals, dominated by Acropora, amount of rubble is far more than could be provided by the amount of live branching forms. Some dead coral not obvious poison or disease, but sosial survey indicates high level of cyanide use, and no coloured dividing line so concluded damage was cyadine rather than disease. No sign of coral predators

Massive sponges seem to be a natural feature of this site, as in many other sites in Central Sulawesi, not an indicator of any form of degradation. In segment 1, a small school of snappers was seen off-transect. Very few indicator invertebrates, even off-transect, zeros really are nul observations. % bleaching of colonies was not recorded by observer. Indication of poison fishing. From the point of view of food fish/invertebrates, this transect was like a ghost town - plenty of homes but no-one there.

"Hilarys Reef and Convention Reef, Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental 3985","Bleaching : Bleaching occurred over  August and September 1998. Corals were affected to a depth of 18m. Percentage of bleached corals was seen to range from 35 to 90% between 0 and 25m depth around the whole island. The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef. In deeper depths, more delicate plating forms such as were seen to bleach, but not as severely as the P. clavus from the 6m quadrats.Bleaching over the shallower areas was also recorded in soft coral forms (Sinularia flexibilis, other Sinularia spp. and Sarcophyton spp.). Within the first year from September 1998 to August 1999, there was little or no recovery of soft corals.<a href=""http://www.reefbase.org/threats/images/danjungan_bl_1998.pdf"" target=""_blank""> Bleaching pictures </a>

Cape Arhnem 4032,"Bleaching : Signs of coral bleaching were found at Cape Arhnem (12o 19 S 136o 56 E), The Northern Territory, Australia, ~ 30 km from Gove/Nhulunbuy town during our survey of the area at 1 March 2005. Bleaching (so-called""shallow bleaching"") was probably resulted from series of short coral exposures during low spring tides in October-December 2004 and in January-February 2005 (Seafarer Tides 2004-2005).  Fortunately, all exposures happened at mid-afternoon hours between 3:30pm - 5:30pm.<br>Area bleached is restricted to the reef flat at the depth 0.5-2 m withextremely rich coral reefs (chiefly Acropora spp, such as A. chytherea,A.grandis, A. microphhtalmata, A. hyacinthus.   From 15 to 25% of coralcolonies still have some marks of bleaching during our survey at 1 of March 2005.<br>Corals were found in the state of recovery and no mortality as a result of bleaching has been recorded.

Garig Gunak Barlu National Park 3904,"Bleaching : 40-60% of live coral cover in the area and 100% is affected.Bleaching started in 8/11/2002.Fringe coral reefs, typical for the area are located in very shallow water 1.5-2 m depth. Only single Montipora colonies and small staghorn acroporids reefs (lesser than 5 % of all coral reef area) are located at 3-4 m depth. This year bleaching has not been related to the hot spot development in the area like this have happened in November 2001. Surface water temperature has reached coral bleaching threshold according to SST (http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/orad/sub/sst_series_cobourg_cur.html), but no hot spots have been discovered in the area.Temperature  measurements made in situ showed no temperature increase beyond 28C at 1 meter depth. However, shallow reefs have been almost  completely exposed to the sun heat during low spring tide hours which happened at midday hours four time: at he beginning and the end of November 2002, and at the beginning and the end of December 2002. Water remaining in temporal pools and depressions sometimes was reaching temperature of 40C  and more. Each low spring period that fell on midday time lasted for at least three hours and had happening for 6-7 days. Eventually, our coral reefs have been exposed to the direct sun  heat for at least 72 hours. All these coincided with very hot weather without wind, intensive solar radiations and absence of clouds. Moderate to large swings towards warmer than average daytime temperatures was also apparent in the north of  Australia according to Australian National Climate Centre. Monsoon was delayed for at least a month.As a result,  100 percent  of all coral colonies got bleached. Solitary corals colonies and staghorn acroporids reefs located   at the depth of 3-4 meters have been also affected by bleaching. Coral reefs condition assessment was done in the end of January after ~ 3 weeks non-stop storm and rain which brought water temperature down to 27.5-28C .

So cumulatively it seems the majority in the shallows is either bleached or was bleached in late Dec/early Jan and is now dead or partly dead.Bleaching started around mid-3rd week December 08.Ive observed on coastal reefs and off several nearby islands, but understand it also prevails some way down the coast at least in the inner islands (Ive not checked the outer reef nor greater depths)

They are quite small (the largest, Niolam, is about 16 km in diameter) and they all have narrow fringing reefs. <br>We found that a significant proportion of the live coral on the shallow fringing reefs was bleached.  Some corals had already died from the event, and others may have been lightly affected or were recovering (pale state). Initial estimates are that about a quarter to a third of all live corals were bleached, and a smaller proportion had already died.

Heron Island 2605,"Bleaching : Acropora colonies (staghorn corals) are mainly affected although there is a general whitening of most species. The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached. Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat. Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon. A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.Bleaching of other corals was rare. Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. Bleaching was in recovery phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks - perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal beingcompletely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the reef crest - most sites are bleached to about 20-30% down to 10 m.  Bleaching is noticeably greater closer to Gladstone (seen from the air as your fly by Heli to Gladstone) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 20/3/2002)

Kharabah Island 2657,"Bleaching : Observations at Kharabah Island (Most eastern Daymaniyat Island) made in late August showed that the most affected corals were in water less than 6m depth. The most severely affected species were Astreopora (100% of colonies totally bleached), Symphyllia recta (60-70%), Goniopora species (50%), Platygyra (20% of colonies partially bleached), and soft corals (25% of colonies bleached). Together the hard coral species make up a coral cover of 20% out of a total hard coral cover of approximately 85%.  Coral communities in deeper water, 6-20m appeared unaffected.Corals along the mainland coast of Muscat appear also to be largelyunaffected, and intermittent monitoring for bleached corals continues.

"Nuuuli pool, Tutuila 4319","Bleaching : Staghorn corals (Acropora formosa = A. muricata) have begun bleaching in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summers bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.

Tutuila Lagoons 4000,"Bleaching : A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.

Majuro 4033,"Bleaching : Majuro is currently suffering renewed minor bleaching (first noticed on Feb 13 2005) restricted to the reef flat (chiefly small Acropora spp, such as A. digitifera).  Perhaps this is related to the ""hotspot"" to the south.  While this sort of shallow bleaching (upper half meter or less) is not unusual (we had similar bleaching in 2000, 2002 and 2004) what is novel is the season; previous bleachings were limited to the autumn (Sept-Nov) when maximal temperatures occur.  A week later (Feb. 20) a dive computer gave a temp. reading of 84 F at the surface and 82 F 10 meters down.  This bleaching is on the southern leeward shore, sheltered from the tradewinds, during a period of calm condition (i.e., minimal swell).

"Lalati Resort, Beqa 7166","Bleaching : Visibilty was low due to a large amount of fine white particulate matter in the water, often found in sheltered bays in Fiji (not river silt); Many corals damaged where spear fishermen have missed and broken corals instead, indicating exceptionally heavy spearfishing pressures.Many corals were in the very early stages of bleaching, appearing pale over 100% of the colony, but not yet actually bleached. As water temperatures were not yet very high (28oC) this may be due to sedimentation. Also many corals (mostly Acropora digitate and branching forms) dead, possibly from temperature-related bleaching in 2006.

Mamanucas 3897,"Bleaching : In April 2002, water temperatures around the Mamanucas reached approximately 30-31C for approximately one month. This led to some bleaching at a national scale, principally of the genus Acropora corals, but only in shallow waters. Shallow areas (2-4m) in which the CCC Fiji data is derived showed 5 % of coral colonies of the genus Acropora having been bleached. There was also one large area of Acropora coral at 14 m near Sunflower reef where a 15 m2 area was bleached, but only the apical portions of the colonys branches. Other than this small percent of bleached coral and the deeper bleaching at Sunflower, there appeared to be little overall impact of the bleaching in the Mamanucas for April-May 2002. Bleaching in 2002 was not nearly as significant as the bleaching event that occurred in 2000.

The dead coral had high algae cover but had not collapsed, so it seems likely that it was dead 1-2 years, and was killed in a previous summer bleaching.

Funafuti Lagoon 2504,"Bleaching : For the two sites we have analyzed so far, we recorded an average % bleached for the most dominant coral family, Acroporidae (Acropora muricata, A. robusta etc), to be 70%.  Bleaching is equally distributed in branching and tabulate acroporas. A little less than 20% average cover was recorded for Pocilloporidae (e.g. Styllophora sp.), while Agariciidae, Faviidae and Mussidae < 10%.  Bleaching was particularly dominant over the reef crest and slope habitats though, average 50% bleaching was recorded in low coverage of acropora colonies at the lagoon floor.  ""We recorded 30.5 deg. C average for water temperature with the highest being 32 deg. C.  We suspect bleaching to have been started end of March and April.""

"Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii 3934","Bleaching : Gradual warming occurred during July in Kaneohe Bay as solar input increased and wind speed diminished.  By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.
