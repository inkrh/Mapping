But the Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) has achieved such fame as  Shini   a lizard who teaches the importance of protecting his species to local schoolchildren.\nThe lizard is just one of 115 species including a snail-eating turtle and a horseshoe bat discovered in the Greater Mekong region in 2016. That s an average of more than two new species found each week. A new WWF Report  Stranger Species  documents the work of hundreds of scientists around the world who have discovered previously unknown amphibians  fish  reptiles  plants and mammals in Cambodia  Laos  Myanmar  and Vietnam.\nMeet a few of the Greater Mekong species from the latest report:The mountain horseshoe bat  (Rhinolophus monticolus)  is found in the evergreen forests of mountainous Laos and Thailand. Its distinctive horseshoe-shaped facial structure known as a noseleaf has been likened to a character from the cantina scene in Star Wars.The Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) is a medium-sized lizard that lives in remote freshwater and evergreen forest habitats of South China and Northern Vietnam. It is so heavily threatened by habitat destruction  coal mining and collection for the pet trade that as few as 200 individuals could remain in Vietnam. The lizard has been immortalized in a comic strip in which the character  Shini   explains to school children the importance of protecting lizards.A snail eating turtle (Malayemys isan) was discovered by a scientist in a local market in Northeast Thailand where shopkeepers say they pulled the animals from a nearby canal. The turtle is under threat from growing infrastructure including dikes and dams.Two new species of moles were found in a network of streams and rivers in Vietnam. Unlike many species in the region  moles have been able to maintain a steady population and escape threats as going underground keeps them out of site from poachers and safe from other threats.A vibrantly colored frog  Odorrana Mutschmanni is one of five new species discovered in the same karst forest in Northern Vietnam. Their forest home is in desperate need of protection as it is threatened by quarrying for cement and road construction.The freshwater loach fish from Cambodia sports striking black and brown stripes on its elongated body. So far these fish have only been found in smaller streams and not in any larger mainstream rivers  where large hydropower dams and agricultural runoff can threaten wildlife.\nSince 1997  more than 2 500 species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong region. It s a positive sign of biodiversity in a region where wildlife remains under tremendous threat. Intense development from mines to roads to dams threatens the habitats so many species call home. Poaching for bushmeat and the illegal wildlife trade puts wildlife at dire risk. As a result  many species could be lost before they are even discovered.\nWWF is working to stop the illegal wildlife trade by shutting down the biggest illegal markets in the Greater Mekong. Working with partners and across borders  WWF aims to significantly reduce illegal trade in key threatened species such as elephants  tigers and rhinos through legislation  transboundary cooperation and improved law enforcement. By safeguarding these species  we protect biodiversity and keep important natural landscapes intact.\n      ", "Title": "New species discovered in the Greater Mekong"}, {"URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/donald-trump-says-us-could-re-enter-paris-climate-deal-itv-interview", "Description": "In ITV interview US president also says he would take tougher stand on Brexit than Theresa MayDonald Trump has said the United States could re-enter the Paris climate change agreement - and that he would have taken a  tougher stand  in Brexit negotiations than Theresa May.The US president said his country could join the international accord if it had a  completely different deal  but called the existing agreement a  terrible deal  and a  disaster  for the US.

We meet the survivalists prepared for catastopheMidway through December  while temperatures in the UK plummeted  heaps of snow drove transport services into a frenzy and schools into closure. Water supplies froze. Medical assistance slowed  threatening genuine peril. People began to store fuel. Across the Midlands  families were left without power - no electricity  no heat - in some instances overnight. For those of us safely tucked away indoors  or unaffected by the weather  the news could be shocking. It also brought to mind an unnerving question: would you be ready if calamity struck?The answer for most of us is no  not really. We tend to think of disaster as something that happens to others. But a growing number of people around the UK - preppers or survivalists  in the parlance - are quietly gearing up for the worst. They're filling pantries with supplies in case their local food chains disintegrate  storing thermals in their cars in the event that they break down in a snowstorm  packing  go-bags  with a collection of bare necessities - water  food  medicine  perhaps a portable stove - supposing they need to leave home in a hurry. If catastrophe were to strike  the thinking goes  a preparatory head-start might well be life-saving.
