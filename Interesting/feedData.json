Up to the moment the water swept away her parents' field in Kachaso in the Nsanje district of Malawi  they had been scraping a living. Afterwards they were reduced to scavenging for bits of firewood to sell.So when a young man came to their door and asked for the 13-year old's hand in marriage  the couple didn't think about it for too long  lest he look elsewhere. Ntonya begged them to change their minds. She was too young  she pleaded. She didn't want to leave. But it was to no avail. Her parents sat her down and spelled it out for her: the weather had changed and taken everything from them. There was not enough food to go around. They couldn't afford another mouth at the table.

It was kicked off by a newspaper story reporting a  calculation  of mysterious origin that suggested a single Google search generated 7 grams of CO2  which is about half of the carbon footprint of boiling a kettle. Irked by this  Google responded with a blogpost saying that this estimate was much too high.  In terms of greenhouse gases   the company said   one Google search is equivalent to about 0.2 grams of CO2. The current EU standard for tailpipe [exhaust] emissions calls for 140 grams of CO2 per kilometre driven  but most cars don't reach that level yet. Thus  the average car driven for one kilometre (0.6 miles for those in the US) produces as many greenhouse gases as a thousand Google searches. Every service that Google provides is provided via its huge data centres  which consume vast amounts of electricity to power and cool the servers  and are therefore responsible for the emission of significant amounts of CO2. Since the advent of the modern smartphone in about 2007 our reliance on distant data centres has become total  because everything we do on our phones involves an interaction with the  cloud  and therefore has a carbon footprint.

Marine biologists have found their population has plunged abruptly in the past few years and that there may now only be around 100 reproductively mature females left in the sea. Many scientists fear the species could soon become the first great whale to become extinct in modern times.The principal cause for the North Atlantic right whale's precipitous decline has been the use of increasingly heavy commercial fishing gear dropped on to the sea bed to catch lobsters  snow crabs and hogfish off the east coast of North America. Whales swim into the rope lines attached to these sea-bed traps and their buoys and become entangled. In some cases hundreds of metres of heavy rope  tied to traps weighing more than 60kg  have been found wrapped around whales.  We have records of animals carrying these huge loads - which they cannot shake off - for months and months   said Julie van der Hoop  of Aarhus University in Denmark.
