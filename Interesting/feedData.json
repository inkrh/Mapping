But the Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) has achieved such fame as  Shini   a lizard who teaches the importance of protecting his species to local schoolchildren.\nThe lizard is just one of 115 species including a snail-eating turtle and a horseshoe bat discovered in the Greater Mekong region in 2016. That s an average of more than two new species found each week. A new WWF Report  Stranger Species  documents the work of hundreds of scientists around the world who have discovered previously unknown amphibians  fish  reptiles  plants and mammals in Cambodia  Laos  Myanmar  and Vietnam.\nMeet a few of the Greater Mekong species from the latest report:The mountain horseshoe bat  (Rhinolophus monticolus)  is found in the evergreen forests of mountainous Laos and Thailand. Its distinctive horseshoe-shaped facial structure known as a noseleaf has been likened to a character from the cantina scene in Star Wars.The Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) is a medium-sized lizard that lives in remote freshwater and evergreen forest habitats of South China and Northern Vietnam. It is so heavily threatened by habitat destruction  coal mining and collection for the pet trade that as few as 200 individuals could remain in Vietnam. The lizard has been immortalized in a comic strip in which the character  Shini   explains to school children the importance of protecting lizards.A snail eating turtle (Malayemys isan) was discovered by a scientist in a local market in Northeast Thailand where shopkeepers say they pulled the animals from a nearby canal. The turtle is under threat from growing infrastructure including dikes and dams.Two new species of moles were found in a network of streams and rivers in Vietnam. Unlike many species in the region  moles have been able to maintain a steady population and escape threats as going underground keeps them out of site from poachers and safe from other threats.A vibrantly colored frog  Odorrana Mutschmanni is one of five new species discovered in the same karst forest in Northern Vietnam. Their forest home is in desperate need of protection as it is threatened by quarrying for cement and road construction.The freshwater loach fish from Cambodia sports striking black and brown stripes on its elongated body. So far these fish have only been found in smaller streams and not in any larger mainstream rivers  where large hydropower dams and agricultural runoff can threaten wildlife.\nSince 1997  more than 2 500 species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong region. It s a positive sign of biodiversity in a region where wildlife remains under tremendous threat. Intense development from mines to roads to dams threatens the habitats so many species call home. Poaching for bushmeat and the illegal wildlife trade puts wildlife at dire risk. As a result  many species could be lost before they are even discovered.\nWWF is working to stop the illegal wildlife trade by shutting down the biggest illegal markets in the Greater Mekong. Working with partners and across borders  WWF aims to significantly reduce illegal trade in key threatened species such as elephants  tigers and rhinos through legislation  transboundary cooperation and improved law enforcement. By safeguarding these species  we protect biodiversity and keep important natural landscapes intact.\n      ", "Title": "New species discovered in the Greater Mekong"}, {"URL": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WWFStories/~3/h8SHsxY-ipk/new-species-of-orangutan-announced", "Description": "A new great ape species the Tapanuli orangutan was officially announced by an international team of scientists today.

The growing sense that we have become an 'us and them' society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation   wrote Mr Milburn in his resignation letter.This was a moment that confirmed two things about Theresa May's government. First  there is no energy in Whitehall for anything except getting out of the EU. The commission had been left to stew  its recommendations ignored  departing members not replaced  its resources inadequate. Second  Mrs May's words about helping the so-called left-behind may have been meant in earnest but it will be no more of a priority for her than it was for her predecessors. No wonder the commission's reports had grown ever more blunt about the failure to improve the chances of the least well off.

Even when we think we're being rational  we don't know what that isIt's been coming on for a while  so I can't claim any eureka moment. But something did crystallise this year. What I changed my mind about was people. More specifically  I realised that people cannot be relied upon to make rational choices. We would have fixed global warming by now if we were rational. Instead  there's a stubborn refusal to let go of the idea that environmental degradation is a  debate  in which there are  two sides .Debating is a great way of exploring an issue when there is real room for doubt and nuance. But when a conclusion can be reached simply by assembling a mountain of known facts  debating is just a means of pitting the rational against the irrational.
