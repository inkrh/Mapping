War-torn Vienna is his canvas; its desperate people his oils. He needs a climate of fear and darkness in order to paint his masterpiece.  In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias  they had warfare  terror  murder and bloodshed  but they produced Michelangelo  Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance   Lime explains.  In Switzerland they had brotherly love  500 years of democracy and peace  and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. The Third Man was scripted by Graham Greene  but its most famous speech was improvised on the spot. Welles would later say he'd pilfered it from  an old Hungarian play  the name of which he'd forgotten  but there are more philosophical echoes here  too. He might have been referencing Walter Benjamin  who argued that  at the base of every major work of art is a pile of barbarism   or Friedrich Nietzsche  who felt that  the strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity . True artists  in other words  are ruthless and amoral. They make their own rules and leave casualties in their wake. But what would you rather have in your life?
