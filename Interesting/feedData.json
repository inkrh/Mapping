But the Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) has achieved such fame as  Shini   a lizard who teaches the importance of protecting his species to local schoolchildren.\nThe lizard is just one of 115 species including a snail-eating turtle and a horseshoe bat discovered in the Greater Mekong region in 2016. That s an average of more than two new species found each week. A new WWF Report  Stranger Species  documents the work of hundreds of scientists around the world who have discovered previously unknown amphibians  fish  reptiles  plants and mammals in Cambodia  Laos  Myanmar  and Vietnam.\nMeet a few of the Greater Mekong species from the latest report:The mountain horseshoe bat  (Rhinolophus monticolus)  is found in the evergreen forests of mountainous Laos and Thailand. Its distinctive horseshoe-shaped facial structure known as a noseleaf has been likened to a character from the cantina scene in Star Wars.The Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) is a medium-sized lizard that lives in remote freshwater and evergreen forest habitats of South China and Northern Vietnam. It is so heavily threatened by habitat destruction  coal mining and collection for the pet trade that as few as 200 individuals could remain in Vietnam. The lizard has been immortalized in a comic strip in which the character  Shini   explains to school children the importance of protecting lizards.A snail eating turtle (Malayemys isan) was discovered by a scientist in a local market in Northeast Thailand where shopkeepers say they pulled the animals from a nearby canal. The turtle is under threat from growing infrastructure including dikes and dams.Two new species of moles were found in a network of streams and rivers in Vietnam. Unlike many species in the region  moles have been able to maintain a steady population and escape threats as going underground keeps them out of site from poachers and safe from other threats.A vibrantly colored frog  Odorrana Mutschmanni is one of five new species discovered in the same karst forest in Northern Vietnam. Their forest home is in desperate need of protection as it is threatened by quarrying for cement and road construction.The freshwater loach fish from Cambodia sports striking black and brown stripes on its elongated body. So far these fish have only been found in smaller streams and not in any larger mainstream rivers  where large hydropower dams and agricultural runoff can threaten wildlife.\nSince 1997  more than 2 500 species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong region. It s a positive sign of biodiversity in a region where wildlife remains under tremendous threat. Intense development from mines to roads to dams threatens the habitats so many species call home. Poaching for bushmeat and the illegal wildlife trade puts wildlife at dire risk. As a result  many species could be lost before they are even discovered.\nWWF is working to stop the illegal wildlife trade by shutting down the biggest illegal markets in the Greater Mekong. Working with partners and across borders  WWF aims to significantly reduce illegal trade in key threatened species such as elephants  tigers and rhinos through legislation  transboundary cooperation and improved law enforcement. By safeguarding these species  we protect biodiversity and keep important natural landscapes intact.\n      ", "Title": "New species discovered in the Greater Mekong"}, {"URL": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WWFStories/~3/h8SHsxY-ipk/new-species-of-orangutan-announced", "Description": "A new great ape species the Tapanuli orangutan was officially announced by an international team of scientists today.

His tally reached 59 in Melbourne. This is a lot for a 35-year-old - in fact  it's a heavy load for a 25-year-old  especially when the temperature occasionally creeps above 35C. That figure of 59 is also a compliment to Anderson. He was England's best bowler and Joe Root kept turning to him in his attempts to defeat Australia and a dire surface for cricket. That pitch was so unresponsive   said Anderson after the match.  I know my speed dropped off in my 58th and 59th overs. By then I was bowling it  looking up at the speed and then he [Steve Smith  inevitably] was hitting it. It's quite demoralising when it gets to that point.

Similarly  scientists find it much easier to predict what the world will look like in the next decade rather than in a century. This is because the technology of tomorrow relies on the science of today - it is only after we have understood a certain concept that we can think about how to put it to use. A famous example is Michael Faraday's research into electricity and magnetism in the 1830s. It was only decades later that others saw how to use this new knowledge to build electric motors and power generators  inventions that transformed our world. Sometimes  of course  scientific discoveries lead to completely unforeseen applications - the internet is one such example.But what about 2018? Surely the world won't look too different? All I can say for certain is there are three technologies we're going hear much more about next year  even more than we have done this year. The first is the incredible opportunities opening up in medicine thanks to advances in gene editing. Just this year  we saw the development of techniques that allow for single molecules on DNA to be tweaked or replaced  with the potential to reverse genetic mutations responsible for a whole host of terrible conditions. Soon we will be able to remove  very precisely  a faulty gene responsible for diseased cells  and replace it with the  healthy   correctly functioning version  thus treating genetic disorders  such as sickle cell anaemia  cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. The flip side is that this advance opens up the insidious possibility of modifying the genome in an embryo (so-called germline editing) leading  potentially  to designer babies and genetically modified superhumans. Debate about the ethics of such techniques needs to be had  and quickly.
