But the disapproval  threats and even violence only served to cement a bond that has lasted 24 yearsThe year was 1993. I was 17  and heading for the sixth form at a new school in Hounslow  west London. I wasn't expecting it to change my life. Looking back  I struggle to remember a white face there. It was a sea of brown  where Muslim  Sikh and Hindu students mixed easily: it seemed a surprisingly harmonious environment. Beneath the surface  though  cultural tension lurked  particularly between the Muslims and the Sikhs. All I had to do was keep my head down and my mouth shut. I didn't want any part in the school politics.I remember the girls. They all seemed to wear black leather jackets and black platform shoes and they listened to R B. Rajinder was different. She wore flowing flowery skirts and a faded jean jacket with scuffed Dr Martens boots and listened to Guns N' Roses. I had never met anyone like her.

A new film does just this. In The Man Who Invented Christmas  Dickens is not the bearded patriarch and arch-sentimentalist of Victorian culture  but a young chap startled by his sudden fame and with no confidence that it will last. Dan Stevens's kinetic incarnation of Dickens is all anxious twitchiness  his youthful energy scarcely held in. He has written a sequence of bestsellers  but his last couple of books have been  flops . Now  in 1843  he needs another hit. So - with the help of his bosom friend John Forster  an (invented) Irish maid  whose ghost stories told to his children he overhears  and his habit of spotting vivid characters among people he meets in the street - he dreams up A Christmas Carol. And  incidentally  teaches all of us what Christmas should be like.Stevens  at 35  is a few years older than Dickens was at the time. With five novels behind him and another  Martin Chuzzlewit  appearing in monthly instalments  he was still only 31. The young Dickens was a dandy  as dashingly dressed as he is in the film and almost as handsome. He had made it from lowly origins and was ready for the high life. A painting of him by Daniel Maclise in the National Portrait Gallery shows a lustrous-haired buck in his late 20s  his suit as shiny as his locks  gazing into the distance while his silk cravat spills down his chest.

A pot half-full of compost will not lift your soul on a dark December morning  but something in flower may.The selection for winter bedding plants is limited; the obvious choices are violas and pansies. In the darkest days of December and January  they don't flower much  coming back into play as the days lengthen  so the best displays will have something else in the pot  such as erica species heathers that flower from December to April. The white and cream is the least offensive and can be incorporated among ivies and cyclamen to create a restrained look.
