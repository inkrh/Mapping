But the Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) has achieved such fame as  Shini   a lizard who teaches the importance of protecting his species to local schoolchildren.\nThe lizard is just one of 115 species including a snail-eating turtle and a horseshoe bat discovered in the Greater Mekong region in 2016. That s an average of more than two new species found each week. A new WWF Report  Stranger Species  documents the work of hundreds of scientists around the world who have discovered previously unknown amphibians  fish  reptiles  plants and mammals in Cambodia  Laos  Myanmar  and Vietnam.\nMeet a few of the Greater Mekong species from the latest report:The mountain horseshoe bat  (Rhinolophus monticolus)  is found in the evergreen forests of mountainous Laos and Thailand. Its distinctive horseshoe-shaped facial structure known as a noseleaf has been likened to a character from the cantina scene in Star Wars.The Vietnamese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus vietnamensis) is a medium-sized lizard that lives in remote freshwater and evergreen forest habitats of South China and Northern Vietnam. It is so heavily threatened by habitat destruction  coal mining and collection for the pet trade that as few as 200 individuals could remain in Vietnam. The lizard has been immortalized in a comic strip in which the character  Shini   explains to school children the importance of protecting lizards.A snail eating turtle (Malayemys isan) was discovered by a scientist in a local market in Northeast Thailand where shopkeepers say they pulled the animals from a nearby canal. The turtle is under threat from growing infrastructure including dikes and dams.Two new species of moles were found in a network of streams and rivers in Vietnam. Unlike many species in the region  moles have been able to maintain a steady population and escape threats as going underground keeps them out of site from poachers and safe from other threats.A vibrantly colored frog  Odorrana Mutschmanni is one of five new species discovered in the same karst forest in Northern Vietnam. Their forest home is in desperate need of protection as it is threatened by quarrying for cement and road construction.The freshwater loach fish from Cambodia sports striking black and brown stripes on its elongated body. So far these fish have only been found in smaller streams and not in any larger mainstream rivers  where large hydropower dams and agricultural runoff can threaten wildlife.\nSince 1997  more than 2 500 species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong region. It s a positive sign of biodiversity in a region where wildlife remains under tremendous threat. Intense development from mines to roads to dams threatens the habitats so many species call home. Poaching for bushmeat and the illegal wildlife trade puts wildlife at dire risk. As a result  many species could be lost before they are even discovered.\nWWF is working to stop the illegal wildlife trade by shutting down the biggest illegal markets in the Greater Mekong. Working with partners and across borders  WWF aims to significantly reduce illegal trade in key threatened species such as elephants  tigers and rhinos through legislation  transboundary cooperation and improved law enforcement. By safeguarding these species  we protect biodiversity and keep important natural landscapes intact.\n      ", "Title": "New species discovered in the Greater Mekong"}, {"URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/04/jo-brand-bullies-are-lurking-around-every-corner-", "Description": "From provocative standup to gentle jokes about baking  Jo Brand has been making an impact for decades - but just don't call her a 'national treasure'Another Friday night  another comedy panel show  another biscuit  maybe two. And then suddenly  we sedentary viewers of Have I Got News For You sat up. It was early in November and  responding to a headline about an MP taking his personal trainer to the cinema  Ian Hislop had chuckled:  Some of this is not 'high-level' crime  is it?  But Jo Brand  hosting  didn't smile. The temperature changed quite suddenly.  If I can just say   she began   as the only representative of the female gender here today - I know it's not high-level  but it doesn't have to be 'high-level' for women to feel under siege in somewhere like the House of Commons. Actually  for women  if you're constantly being harassed  even in a small way  that builds up  and that wears you down.  There was a pause. Then the audience started cheering.Today  Brand  a woman who refuses to be described as a national treasure  preferring  national disgrace   says she didn't plan to say a word.  I'm a real hectorer usually - it was lucky I didn't shout  because otherwise it wouldn't have taken the wind out of everyone's sails in the same way. It had an impact.  She says this as if it was a surprise but  of course  Brand  now 60  has been making an impact for decades  first with her monotone standup about men and weight ( I read that book Fat Is A Feminist Issue  got a bit desperate halfway through and ate it ) and today for her dry contributions to primetime TV where  as well presenting the sister programme to The Great British Bake Off  she is often the lone woman on a panel of men.
